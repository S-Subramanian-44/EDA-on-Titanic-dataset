# Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

Excited to share the successful completion of my second task as a Data Science Intern at Prodigy Infotech! ðŸ“Š This time, I delved into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the Titanic dataset, employing simple yet powerful techniques to unravel insights.

### Key Steps and Achievements:

1. ðŸ“‰ **Handling Missing Values with Mean using Pandas:**
   - Implemented a robust strategy to address missing values, ensuring the integrity of the dataset.
   - Leveraged Pandas to fill missing values with the mean, maintaining data accuracy.

2. ðŸ“Š **Seaborn Library for Visualization:**
   - Employed the Seaborn library to craft compelling visualizations.
   - Explored the survival dynamics concerning crucial factors:
     - **Age:** Unraveled age-related patterns in survival rates.
     - **Sex:** Examined the impact of gender on survival probabilities.
     - **Parch (Parents/Children Aboard):** Explored the correlation between family ties and survival.
     - **SibSp (Siblings/Spouses Aboard):** Investigated the influence of companionship on survival.
     - **Pclass (Passenger Class):** Analyzed survival disparities based on passenger class.

3. ðŸ“ˆ **Matplotlib.pyplot for Custom Visualizations:**
   - Enhanced the visual storytelling by incorporating Matplotlib.pyplot for customized charts.
   - Captivated trends and nuances, making the data narrative more accessible.

Thrilled to contribute to the data-driven journey at Prodigy Infotech! Eager to tackle more complex challenges and continue unraveling insights that drive informed decisions. ðŸ’¡ðŸš¢ #DataScience #EDA #ExploratoryDataAnalysis #TitanicDataset #ProdigyInfotech
